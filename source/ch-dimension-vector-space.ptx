  <introduction>
    <p>
      Thus far in this text, the only way we have related vector spaces to each other is through linear transformations between those spaces. But we have not had any <em>intrinsic</em> quality of a vector space that enables any comparison between spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notion of the <em>dimension</em> of a vector space allows just such a comparison. In this chapter we will develop the necessary machinery for defining the dimension of a space, and we will also use this concept for other useful notions about matrices, linear transformations, and more.
