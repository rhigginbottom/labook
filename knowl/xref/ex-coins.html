<div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="para">Alex reaches into his pocket and pulls out a handful of coins. He tells us that he’s holding 90 cents in his hand, consisting of only nickels (worth five cents each) and quarters (worth 25 cents each). How many coins of each type is Alex holding?</div>
<div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="para logical">
<div class="para">We can model this information with a linear equation. Let <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> be the number of nickels in Alex’s hand, and let <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> be the number of quarters. The equation that captures the information Alex shared is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
5x + 25y = 90\text{.}\tag{1.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
</div>
<div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="para">In this case, we don’t have enough information to answer Alex’s question. It could be that Alex is holding three nickels and three quarters (<span class="process-math">\(15+75=90\)</span>) or that he is holding 13 nickels and one quarter (<span class="process-math">\(65+25=90\)</span>). There are quite a few solutions to equation <a href="sec-intro-systems.html#eqn-coins" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/eqn-coins.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Equation 1.1">(1.1)</a>. (Note that in this example, since it would not make sense to have only part of a coin, we need our values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> to be non-negative integers.)</div>
<div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="para logical">
<div class="para">Now imagine that Alex gives us additional information by telling us that he is holding exactly ten coins. We can put this information into a second linear equation, and we now have what is called a <dfn class="terminology">system of equations</dfn>. We need to know what values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> satisfy the following equations simultaneously:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
5x+25y \amp= 90 \\
x+y \amp= 10 \text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
</div>
<div xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="para">A small amount of work shows us that the values <span class="process-math">\(x=8\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y=2\)</span> satisfy these equations simultaneously. (The reader should not worry right now about where those numbers came from. We’ll get there soon.) This means that Alex is holding eight nickels and two quarters.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-intro-systems.html#ex-coins">in-context</a></span>
