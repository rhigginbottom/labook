We assume there is no pivot in the final column of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Then when we consider the linear equations which correspond to the rows of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> we see that each of the basic variables can be written in terms of the free variables, if any free variables exist. If no free variables exist, then all basic variables have an assigned value and the system is consistent. In the case that there is at least one free variable, we can pick an element of <span class="process-math">\(\rr\)</span>—let’s say, <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span>—to assign to each of the free variables. This produces a solution to the linear system, and our system is consistent.</div> <div class="para">We will prove the contrapositive of the other implication. If there is a pivot in the final column of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> then the corresponding linear equation reduces to <span class="process-math">\(0=1\text{.}\)</span> This means that there is no solution to the linear system, so the system is inconsistent.</div></article></details><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-results.html#thm-consistent-system">in-context</a></span>
