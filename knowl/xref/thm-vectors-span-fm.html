If the RREF of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> has a pivot in every row, then there cannot be a pivot in the final column of the RREF of <span class="process-math">\([A \mid \bfb]\)</span> since each row already contains one pivot.</div>
<div class="para">We will prove the contrapositive of the other implication. Suppose that the RREF of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> does not have a pivot in every row. We will create a vector in <span class="process-math">\(\ff^m\)</span> which is not in the span of this set of vectors. Since the RREF of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> does not have a pivot in every row, let the smallest row number with no pivot be <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> Form the augmented matrix with the RREF of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and the vector <span class="process-math">\(\bfe_k\text{.}\)</span> Now reverse the elementary row operations that were taken to reduce <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to its RREF. The result will be an augmented matrix <span class="process-math">\([A \mid \bfb]\)</span> which is related to an inconsistent system. (There will be a pivot in the final column of the RREF of this matrix. We constructed it this way!) This proves that the set <span class="process-math">\(\{\bfv_1, \ldots, \bfv_n \}\)</span> does not span <span class="process-math">\(\ff^m\text{.}\)</span>
