<div class="para">The definitions of <span class="process-math">\(+\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\cdot\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\cc\)</span> show that <span class="process-math">\(\cc\)</span> is closed under addition and multiplication. (Notably, this relies on <span class="process-math">\(\rr\)</span> being closed under addition and multiplication!) To prove that the addition in <span class="process-math">\(\cc\)</span> is commutative, we consider two complex numbers <span class="process-math">\(a+bi\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c+di\text{.}\)</span> Then</div>
